    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Ofe Onugbu, also known as Bitterleaf Soup, is a traditional Nigerian soup made with bitterleaf (Vernonia
        amygdalina) as its main ingredient.
        The soup is typically prepared with assorted meats, such as beef, goat meat, or cow tripe, and can also include
        fish or other seafood.
        Other key ingredients coco-yam, include palm oil, crayfish, onions, and a variety of local spices and
        seasonings. </p>
    <p> The bitterness of the bitterleaf is balanced by the other ingredients, resulting in a rich and flavorful soup
        that is popular in Nigeria and other parts of West Africa.
        Ofe Onugbu is often served with fufu (a starchy side dish made from cassava, plantains, or yams) or pounded yam.

        Preparations
    </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Boil the meats:</strong> Start by boiling tougher meats like cow leg and shaki until slightly
                tender. Then add beef or other softer meats. When all the meats are tender, add the stockfish and cook
                until soft.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Boil the cocoyam:</strong> Boil the cocoyam with the skin on until tender (about 20 minutes on
                medium heat). Peel off the skin and pound the cocoyam in a mortar until smooth, or chop into small
                chunks and pur√©e in a blender or food processor. Set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Wash the bitter leaves:</strong> Wash the bitter leaves with hot water to reduce bitterness. If
                needed, boil the leaves with enough water for 15 minutes, then rinse with cold water. If using dried
                bitter leaves, soak them in warm water to plump them up and remove dirt.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Prepare the soup:</strong> When the meats and fish are soft, add crayfish, smoked prawns, and
                blended pepper. Stir and combine. Add palm oil and allow it to combine for 3-4 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Thicken the soup:</strong> Reduce the heat to low and add the blended cocoyam into the stock in
                small amounts. The consistency should be semi-fluid. Allow the cocoyam to dissolve and thicken the soup
                for 2-3 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Add final ingredients:</strong> Add ogiri (fermented locust beans), stir, and combine. Taste for
                seasoning and adjust if necessary. Finally, add the washed bitter leaves and cook for an additional 2-3
                minutes. Do not overcook the vegetables.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Serve:</strong> Your Ofe Onugbu is ready to be served. It can be enjoyed with fufu, pounded yam,
                or any other swallow of your choice.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Serve with Pounded Yam or any swallow of your choice</strong></p>
